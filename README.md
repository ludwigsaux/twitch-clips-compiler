# twitch-clips-compiler

What is the project ?

The goal of the project is to make compilations of Twitch clips and publish them on YouTube. To be simple, the user must fill in the name of the Twitch channel he wants to use and specify the number of Twitch clips he wants to use (a default value exists and can be modified). Then, everything will be done automatically, assembling the clips, publishing on YouTube as well as configuring and referencing the video.

Why this project?

I'm a student and I'm learning to develop my skills so I'm inspired by existing projects that seem interesting. I saw a similar project on a French YouTube channel, in his video, V2F, explains how he made a robot that compiles the best Twitch clips of the day and publish them on YouTube. For my case I decided to make a compilation of the channel of my choice. 

I realized this project in python in order to develop my skills and my knowledge in this language but also to develop my skills in Linux and OSs.
